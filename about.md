# Howdy!

Thanks for stopping by, I hope that you have found something interesting, or even better, something of use.

The software community in general has been fantastic from day one. So much so that I felt it was time to start returning the favor. I started dabbling way back in the late 1990's with HTML which led me on a slow and winding journey through many different languages and paradigms. Some of them I learned on my own, some were through work and some of the more obscure were because of school.

For a long time it was simply a hobby, but the light finally switched on that it was what I really enjoyed doing, which is what pointed me in the direction of a formal education. While working and learning my family grew to four people and we relocated to Kansas City from Denver which afforded me my first official software developer job with Perceptive Software.

The last three or so years have taught me so much and so I would like to say __thank you__ to my co-workers as well as the software community in general. If I ever had an issue (and I have had a ton) I was usually able to find a kind soul who had gone through it before and shared their experiences or took the time to answer my "silly" questions on Stack Overflow.

## Thank you!
